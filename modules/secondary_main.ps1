Steps to Create a Facade Script
1. Define a Facade Class: This class will contain methods that internally use the methods from DataTableManager and DataTableOperations.
2. Implement the Facade Class: Each method in this class will perform a specific high-level function by orchestrating calls to methods in DataTableManager and DataTableOperations.
3. Use the Facade in the Main Script: The main script will then only need to make a few calls to the Facade class, simplifying its logic.


Example Implementation

'''




class DataFacade {
    static [void] InitializeDataTables() {
        $customerInfoDT = [DataTableManager]::CreateCustomerInfoDT()
        $sitesStatesDT = [DataTableManager]::CreateSitesStatesDT()
        $pricesDT = [DataTableManager]::CreatePricesDT()

        # Example data initialization
        [DataTableOperations]::AddRowToDataTable $customerInfoDT "Customer Data"
        [DataTableOperations]::AddRowToDataTable $sitesStatesDT "Site Data"
        [DataTableOperations]::AddRowToDataTable $pricesDT "Price Data"
    }

    static [void] FilterAndProcessData() {
        $customerInfoDT = [DataTableManager]::CreateCustomerInfoDT()
        [DataTableOperations]::AddRowToDataTable $customerInfoDT "Customer Data"
        $filteredCustomerInfoDT = [DataTableOperations]::FilterDataTable $customerInfoDT "Customer"

        # Additional processing can be added here
    }

    # Add more methods to handle other complex operations
}
